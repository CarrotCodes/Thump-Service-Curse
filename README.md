# Thump Curse Service

## Introduction
This is a plugin to provide Curse (chat) support to [Thump](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Thump).

## Building
This mod uses Forge's Gradle wrapper for pretty easy setup and building. There are better guides around the internet for using it, and I don't do anything particularly special.

The general idea:
* **Setup**: `./gradlew clean [setupDevWorkspace/setupDecompWorkspace] [idea/eclipse]`
* **Building**: `./gradlew clean build`

If you run in to odd Gradle issues, doing `./gradlew clean` usually fixes it.
